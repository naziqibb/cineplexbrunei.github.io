				<td> A G-rated motion picture contains nothing in theme, language, nudity, sex, violence or other matters that, in the view of the Rating Board, would offend parents whose younger children view the motion picture. The G rating is not a "certificate of approval", nor does it signify a "children's" motion picture. Some snippets of language may go beyond polite conversation but they are common everyday expressions. No stronger words are present in G-rated motion pictures. Depictions of violence are minimal. No nudity, sex scenes or drug use are present in the motion picture.</td>

			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">(PG) - Parental Guidance Suggested. Some Material May Not Be Suitable For Children</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td colspan="2">A PG-rated motion picture should be investigated by parents before they let their younger children attend. The PG rating indicates, in the view of the Rating Board, that parents may consider some material unsuitable for their children, and parents should make that decision. The more mature themes in some PG-rated motion pictures may call for parental guidance. There may be some profanity and some depictions of violence or brief nudity. But these elements are not deemed so intense as to require that parents be strongly cautioned beyond the suggestion of parental guidance. There is no drug use content in a PG-rated motion picture.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">(M) - Recommended For A Mature Audience</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2">The M rating is recommended for people with a mature perspective but is not deemed too strong for younger viewers. Language is moderate in impact, aggressive or strong coarse language will be used but should be infrequent, and sex may be moderately implied. Sexual violence must be limited. Drug use can be depicted in context.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">(16) -  Restricted To Persons Over 16 Unless Accompanied By A Parent Or Guardian</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2">The "R16" rating is restricted to those 16 and over, meaning those under 16 cannot legally view the film.</td>
